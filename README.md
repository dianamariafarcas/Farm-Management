Farm Management is an application developed using the C# language and SQL concepts in Visual Studio 2022.  It was created to help farmers manage their farm animals and the different actions they can do with them. All this has been done using a database in phpMyAdmin localhost, and the farmer can keep track of his animals, if they are sold, bought, if they have been inseminated, etc. The interface is also user friendly and very intuitive and easy to use.
